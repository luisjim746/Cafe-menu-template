Cafe Menu Template — Responsive Menu App (freeCodeCamp Project)

A clean, responsive café menu built as a freeCodeCamp exercise.

## Purpose / Objective
This project demonstrates practical front-end skills (semantic HTML, modular CSS, responsive layout and basic accessibility) in a small, real-world component: a café menu.  
The goal is twofold: (1) to showcase a finished, well-structured project that was built from start to finish; (2) to serve as a reusable starter template to quickly adapt to a client (bar, cafe, or small restaurant).
## What this repo shows
- Semantic, well-organized HTML structure for menus and sections.
- Responsive styling using modern CSS techniques (responsive layout, flexible boxes/grid, media queries).
- Clean separation of concerns: `index.html` + `styles.css`.
- Considerations for accessibility (logical headings, alt text, readable contrasts).
- Ready for static hosting (GitHub Pages) — deploy in minutes.

## Features
- Responsive menu layout (desktop / tablet / mobile)
- Simple, customizable style variables and comments to speed up edits
- Clear markup that’s easy to extend (add sections, prices, icons)
- Small footprint: no frameworks or build steps required — just HTML + CSS
